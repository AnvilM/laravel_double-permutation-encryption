## About permutation method

A permutation cipher is a symmetric encryption method in which the elements of the original plaintext are swapped. Text elements can be individual characters (the most common case), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, a combination of these cases, and so on. Typical examples of permutations are anagrams.
